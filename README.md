LearnCode
=========

A learning platform for an introduction to programming


Idea
====

A platform-agnostic automated judge, but with a goal to support learning. The initial idea is of developing an Eclipse-plugin, so we can leverage a client-side debugging support and avoid artificial constraints put up competitive environments.


Implications
============

This can be used in the official course for "Introduction to Programming".

Status
=======

- the normal spoj/codeforces style is working fine
- admin could add + edit the questions
- topcoder style still needs some work
- frontend of few pages still needs to be done

Installation
=============

+ create a new database in mysql

+ update the database name, host, username and password of mysql in server_constraints.php

+ run it on your machine and add issues
